## **Feature/Functionality Description**

A clear and concise description of the feature or functionality that will be merged, or is to be merged, and exactly what testing procedures are required to validate it.

If the code that needs to be tested has already been merged, testing procedures/success criteria must be extra thorough to make up for the delay in testing compared to development.

- **Relevant Pull Request/Branch:** #[PR number] / Branch Name

**Reason for Delayed Testing (if applicable)**
Explain why this functionality was merged without immediate testing (e.g., lack of hardware, simulation sufficient for merge, time constraints).

## **Test Plan / Scenarios**
Describe the specific tests that need to be performed to validate this functionality. Be as detailed as possible.
1. **Test Case 1:**
    - **Objective:**
    - **Steps:**
    - **Expected Outcome:**
2. **Test Case 2:**
    - **Objective:**
    - **Steps:**
    - **Expected Outcome:**
3. *(Add more test cases as needed)*

## **Hardware/Software Requirements for Testing**
List any specific hardware (e.g., particular vehicle revision, test rig, sensors) or software (e.g., specific firmware version, diagnostic tools) needed to perform the tests.

## **Additional Details** (not always required)
**Success Criteria**
What defines successful completion of these tests? How will we know the functionality is working as intended?

**Associated Risks if Not Tested / Failure Vectors**
What are the potential consequences if this functionality is not eventually tested or if it fails testing? What are potential ways this test can fail?

**Deadline for Testing (Optional)**
If there's a target timeframe for these tests to be completed, please note it here.

**Documentation Updates Required (Post-Testing)**
List any documentation that will need to be updated once testing is complete and successful.

**Notes/Additional Context**
Any other relevant information.
