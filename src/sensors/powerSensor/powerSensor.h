//Performance Notes: reports 975mV for 1V, and 6024mV for 6V input when tested with divider of 114k and 57k resistors.
//This is close enough to expected values. The linear scaling found exactly 4V at 4V.
//It becomes widely inaccurate for <1V, (not this would be for less than 300mV after the voltage divider)
//Reporting 400mV at 0V. So long as we measure only above 1V with divider, or 300mV raw, we are accurate enough
//if we see 400mV, we can assume 0V input.
//Note: very important to have accurate resistors. With bottom resistor at 2% less than top ones, 
// the projected mesurement is ~50mV below what it should be.
