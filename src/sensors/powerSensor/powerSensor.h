//This is close enough to expected values. The linear scaling found exactly 4V at 4V.
//It becomes widely inaccurate for <1V, (not this would be for less than 300mV after the voltage divider)
//Reporting 400mV at 0V. So long as we measure only above 1V with divider, or 300mV raw, we are accurate enough
//if we see 400mV, we can assume 0V input.
