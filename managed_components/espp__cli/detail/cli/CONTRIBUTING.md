## Ways to Contribute

No contribution to cli is too big or too small! We are
always happy to see user participation in all of its forms.
Here are some of the ways that you can contribute (this is
by no means an exhaustive list):

* Submit a
  [bug report](https://github.com/daniele77/cli/issues).
  We love hearing about broken things, so
  that we can fix them. Any problem is fair game, this includes
  the documentation examples, tests, and repository as well as the
  library itself. Bug reports should be opened on the
  [Issues](https://github.com/daniele77/cli/issues) page.

* Provide
  [feedback](https://github.com/daniele77/cli/issues).
  about the library. If you have used, are using,
  or are thinking about using the library we want to hear about it!
  The more information you provide, the better we will be able
  to ensure that cli meets your needs. You can provide feedback
  as an issue, or email the author directly.

* Test cli.

* Use cli in your next application! At the end of the day, it is the
  goal of the library to provide utility to users so the best way you
  can contribute is simply to use the library!
